Sample function takes a sample of the specified size from the elements of x using either with or without replacement.
The following command is for Random Sampling And Permutations. First it shows a random permutation by the sample function. Then it asks to replace and resample. Then it applies 100 Bernoulli trials with replacement with 0 and 1. Also it gave some hints and common mistakes that you want a sampling with length 1 but if you write it in a way that is mentioned in line 26, you will get a sample of length 10, so it is better to use resample().
```{r}
# NOT RUN {
x <- 1:12
# a random permutation
sample(x)
# bootstrap resampling -- only if length(x) > 1 !
sample(x, replace = TRUE)

# 100 Bernoulli trials
sample(c(0,1), 100, replace = TRUE)

## More careful bootstrapping --  Consider this when using sample()
## programmatically (i.e., in your function or simulation)!

# sample()'s surprise -- example
x <- 1:10
    sample(x[x >  8]) # length 2
    sample(x[x >  9]) # oops -- length 10!
    sample(x[x > 10]) # length 0

## safer version:
resample <- function(x, ...) x[sample.int(length(x), ...)]
resample(x[x >  8]) # length 2
resample(x[x >  9]) # length 1
resample(x[x > 10]) # length 0

## R 3.x.y only
sample.int(1e10, 12, replace = TRUE)
sample.int(1e10, 12) # not that there is much chance of duplicates
# }

```
